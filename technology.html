		<p>Common Programming Error 3.1
Forgetting one of the delimiters of a delimited comment is a syntax error. A programming
language’s syntax specifies the grammatical rules for writing code in that language. A syntax
error occurs when the compiler encounters code that violates C#’s language rules. In
this case, the compiler does not produce an executable file. Instead, it issues one or more
error messages to help you identify and fix the incorrect code. Syntax errors are also called
compiler errors, compile-time errors or compilation errors, because the compiler detects
them during the compilation phase. You cannot execute your app until you correct all the
compilation errors in it. We’ll see that some compile-time errors are not syntax errors.</p>

Get Methods
The fact that in Fig. 4.1 we could create and manipulate an Account object without knowing
its implementation details is called abstraction. This is one of the most powerful
software-engineering benefits of object-oriented programming. Now that we’ve seen class
Account in action (Fig. 4.1), in the next several sections we’ll explain its implementation
in detail. Then, we present a UML diagram that summarizes class Account’s attributes and
operations in a concise graphical representation.f</p>
